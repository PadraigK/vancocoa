An iOS 7 HTML Scraper demo project.

The app scrapes the http://vancocoa.com/events/1 page and parses our the speakers, attendees and event details.

It uses AFNetworking 2.0 and the Objective-C-HTML-Parser projects. I didn't set these up as CocoaPods or submodules because I am a bad person.

I will accept pull requests if you want to develop this into a full Vancocoa app. At present it is hard coded to the first event.s

Feel free to fork it and use it as a template for your own scraping projects.
